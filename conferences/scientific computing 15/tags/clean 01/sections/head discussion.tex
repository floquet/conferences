\section{Discussion}
This entire article is about the difference between the continuous space $\bigL$ and the discrete analog $\bigL$. The differences may seem esoteric, but the consequences can be substantial. And given the prominence of the method of least squares, there is too frequently confusion over the difference between these topologies.

This is a stubborn problem and often practitioners prefer to simply increase the number of mesh points, clinging to hope that convergence is near. 

Hopefully the importance of validation stands out. This involves quantifying our algorithms and then testing the convergence rates. While this would not remedy the problem of topology ambiguity, it would alert us to a problem and inspire investigation.
